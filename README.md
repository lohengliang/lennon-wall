This is a full stack implementation of Lennon Wall.

User can create a wall by adding the wall name to the end of the url. User can then login to create a post that will display his/her name or create a post anonymously.

The frontend is built using React and Redux, and the backend is built using Express. The application is linked to a PostgreSQL database.
